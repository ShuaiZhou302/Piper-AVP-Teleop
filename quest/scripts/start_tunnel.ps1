.SYNOPSIS
  Keeps SSH -L port forwards to cobot_magic alive for Quest teleop.

.DESCRIPTION
  cobot_magic is only reachable through the SOCKS5 VPN proxy already
  configured in ~/.ssh/config (ProxyCommand via ncat), so this reuses that
  host entry rather than opening any new network path. Forwards TWO ports
  over one SSH connection:
    - Port        (default 8770): pose/button stream, webxr_server.py ->
                  quest_server.py (127.0.0.1 only on the robot side).
    - CameraPort  (default 8771): camera stream, the OTHER direction --
                  camera_streamer.py -> webxr_server.py (also 127.0.0.1
                  only on the robot side). Deliberately a separate port
                  from Port, see protocol.py's module docstring for why.

  Windows has no autossh, so this is a plain retry loop: if ssh exits for
  any reason (VPN blip, sleep/wake, robot reboot), it reconnects after a
  short delay. Run this in its own terminal and leave it open for the whole
  teleop session; webxr_server.py does its own reconnect on top of this.

.PARAMETER Port
  Local AND remote port for the pose forward (must match quest_server.py --port).

.PARAMETER CameraPort
  Local AND remote port for the camera forward (must match camera_streamer.py
  --port and webxr_server.py --camera_port).

.PARAMETER SshHost
  SSH config alias to use. Defaults to 'cobot_magic'.

  powershell -File scripts\start_tunnel.ps1
  powershell -File scripts\start_tunnel.ps1 -Port 8770 -CameraPort 8771 -SshHost cobot_magic
